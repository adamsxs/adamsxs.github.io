The trucks in the above picture are made by a Swedish company, Scania, that produces commercial vehicles.
Back in 2016, they proposed a challenge at the 15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis:
given an assortment of features, could any aspiring data scientist predict whether or not the 
air presssure system (APS) had failed? The APS controls a heavy truck's ability to break, so getting this
prediction right has clear consequences both in maintenance costs and for employee safety.
