# Iterative Improvement  

In nearly every opportunity I've been given thus far, professional or otherwise, I've been asked to jump into the job without much relevant experience and learn on the fly.
That trend continued last week while going through the first week of the Metis Data Science bootcamp.  


With that in mind, we dove right into exploratory data analysis. This is where most ideas crash and burn, and the better ones rise out of the ashes.
As someone who has struggled over the years to stop thinking about how to do stuff and simply dive in with pen to paper, I love the idea of EDA
I'm typically pretty scatter-brained about approaching large, open-ended tasks, but the initial EDA step for this project was exciting because of what it forces you to do.
EDA is the physical expression where you get to turn every out-of-left-field idea that pops into tangible steps to actually answer the question.

This is a post about my first project at the Metis Data Science immersive bootcamp in Chicago. The fall cohort started last week, and this is what we produced in the first 5 days.

# Always Another Way  

What has struck me the most since completing the project is just how many different ways other people have come up with to solve the exact same problem.

# Content in the Pipeline

As 2018 draws to a close, we'll have covered a large swath of content at a pretty good pace.
The machine learning algorithms, what I'm most excited about, are varied enough to get a fundamental understanding of the field:
* supervised learning (regression and classification)  
* natural language processing  
* unsupervised learning algorithms  
* deep learning  

To complement those concepts we'll touch on related tools and techniques like:
* web scraping techniques  
* processing costly tasks through AWS  
* SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) database use  
* Data visualization with D3  
* big data tools like Spark and Hadoop    

This experience is all about learning by doing, and I'm looking forward to sharing future passion projects on this site.
